# C++ Learning Project

### DISCLAIMER: This repository contains some ugly code. Treat it as my playground to learn new things.  
As abstract goal I wanted to make The Binding Of Isaac *fangame* - but wanted to make almost everything from scratch

In this repo i *tried* to learn:
 - SFML base
 - rendering with SFML
 - basic animating
 - Project management
 - Working with Git
 - Collision detection
 - Some physics
 - Basic game engine structure
 - Level generation
 - Regular commiting
